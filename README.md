## Cloud Risk Assessment – AWS Environment

**Objective:** Assess cybersecurity risks for a web application hosted on AWS.

**Key Assets:**
- Web Application (Customer portal)
- Database (PII / personal data)
- IAM (user access management)

**Key Risks:**
- Data leakage due to misconfigured storage
- Unauthorized access via weak IAM controls
- Limited logging and monitoring

**Risk Evaluation & Mitigation:**
| Risk                 | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation                |
|----------------------|------------|--------|-----------|----------------------------|
| Data Leakage         | Medium     | High   | High      | Encryption, access control |
| Unauthorized Access  | Medium     | High   | High      | MFA, least privilege       |
| Service Outage       | Low        | Medium | Medium    | Monitoring, backups        |

**Residual Risk:** Medium – acceptable after mitigation.

**Skills Demonstrated:** Cloud Risk Assessment, GRC, ISO 27001, Shared Responsibility Model, Risk Documentation

## AI Risk Assessment & Governance – Chatbot System

**Objective:** Evaluate AI-related risks and governance for a customer support chatbot.

**Key AI Risks:**
- Hallucinations (incorrect information)
- Data leakage (user input & internal docs)
- Bias (unequal responses)

**AI Act Classification:** Limited Risk (EU) – transparency obligations apply

**Mitigation & Governance:**
| Risk            | Control                       |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Hallucinations  | Human oversight               |
| Data Leakage    | Data filtering, secure storage|
| Bias            | Regular audits, monitoring    |

**Residual Risk:** Medium – requires ongoing monitoring

**Governance Recommendations:**
- Establish AI usage policy
- Define accountability and human oversight
- Implement monitoring and review cycles

**Skills Demonstrated:** AI Risk Assessment, AI Governance, EU AI Act, AI Lifecycle Management
