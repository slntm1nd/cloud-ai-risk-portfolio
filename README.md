## Cloud Risk Assessment – AWS Environment

**Objective:**  
Assess cybersecurity and compliance risks for a web application hosted on AWS 
within a shared responsibility model.

**Key Assets:**
- Web Application (Customer portal)
- Database (PII / personal data)
- IAM (user access management)

**Key Risks Identified:**
- Data leakage due to misconfigured storage
- Unauthorized access via weak IAM controls
- Limited logging and monitoring

**Risk Evaluation & Mitigation:**

| Risk                | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation                   |
|---------------------|------------|--------|------------|------------------------------|
| Data Leakage        | Medium     | High   | High       | Encryption, access control   |
| Unauthorized Access | Medium     | High   | High       | MFA, least privilege         |
| Service Outage      | Low        | Medium | Medium     | Monitoring, backups          |

**Residual Risk:**  
Medium – acceptable after mitigation and continuous monitoring.

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
Cloud Risk Assessment, GRC, ISO 27001 concepts, Shared Responsibility Model, Risk Documentation

## AI Risk Assessment & Governance – Chatbot System

**Objective:**  
Evaluate AI-related risks, governance requirements, and responsible AI controls 
for a customer support chatbot.

**Key AI Risks Identified:**
- Hallucinations (incorrect or misleading responses)
- Data leakage (user input & internal documentation)
- Bias (unequal or inconsistent responses)

**AI Act Classification:**  
Limited Risk (EU AI Act) – transparency and governance obligations apply.

**Risk Mitigation & Governance Controls:**

| Risk           | Control                                |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Hallucinations | Human-in-the-loop oversight            |
| Data Leakage   | Data filtering, secure storage         |
| Bias           | Regular audits, performance monitoring |

**Residual Risk:**  
Medium – requires ongoing governance and monitoring.

**Governance Recommendations:**
- Establish formal AI usage and governance policy
- Define accountability and human oversight roles
- Implement continuous monitoring and periodic review cycles

**Skills Demonstrated:**  
AI Risk Assessment, AI Governance, EU AI Act awareness, AI Lifecycle Risk Management
